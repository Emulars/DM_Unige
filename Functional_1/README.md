# Assignment

## Goal
nvestigate the impact of adopting ASSESSOR+ on the development of Selenium WebDriver PO-based Java E2E test suite compared to the classical Manual development

## Apps
4 apps from a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SoftEng-UniGE/BEWT-Specifications) where you can find:
- Docker image of each app already available
- Gherkin descriptions of the test scripts to implement

## Approach
- Manual: full development of a Selenium WebDriver PO-based Java E2E test suite in the IDE
- ASSESSOR+
    - record the test suite in Selenium IDE while annotating the test scripts with ASSESSOR+ Plugin
    - export the Java code
    - generate the PO-based test suite with ASSESSOR+ Generator, and 
    - refine the test scripts if needed

## Procedure
Each student develops each of the four test suite with ONLY one approach and following this order (Group 2): 

- Pretashop: Manual
- Claroline: ASSESSOR+
- Bludit: Manual
- MantisBT: ASSESSOR+

So for each test script to implement:
    
    1. Read the Gherkin test case specfication and

If you are developing a test script MANUALLY:

    2. Save the start time
    3. Develop the test script and when it works
    4. Save the stop time
    5. Move to the next script of the test suit

If you are developing a test suite with ASSESSOR+:

    2. Save the start time (recording)
    3. record the test script with Selenium IDE and ASSESSOR+ Plugin
    4. When the recording of the test script is completed, save the stop time (recording)
    5. Move to the next test script
    6. When the entire test suite is recorded, export the test suite in Java (using Selenium IDE)
    7. Run ASSESSOR+ generator in order to generate the PO-based test suite
    8. start to refine the test scripts (if needed)
    9. save the start time (refinement)
    10. and then refine the first test script and when it works
    11. save the stop time (refinement)
    12. move to the next test script

# Assessor+ Recorder

1. Clone repository from https://github.com/S4064172/AssessorExtension
2. Type "about:debugging" in Firefox browser
3. In the page that opens, click "This Firefox" link
4. Click button "Load temporary Add-on..."  
5. Browse to manifest.json in Assessor+ repo cloned in step 1

Note that steps 2-5 must be repeated any time the browser is closed


# Assessor+ Generator
1. Clone repository from https://github.com/S4064172/Assessor
2. Compile project using Maven
    - From cmd inside the folder, run mvn install
    - A JAR file named assessor-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies will be created under /target folder
    - Weâ€™ll use the JAR later!

# Steps 
1. Read: "FSTT 2024 Assignment-AW.pdf"
2. Read: "Tutorial Selenium+Assessor.pdf"
3. Make practice with Assessor+ on a web app / web site of your choice (both recording and generation)
4. Check in which group you are (Group A or Group B) => "Group Assignment.pdf"
5. Complete the development task (4 test suites) following the order defined in the Excel file: "ASSESSOR+ Time Sheet - Group A.xlsx" or "ASSESSOR+ Time Sheet - Group B.xlsx" - when you import in VS Code the code generated by ASSESSOR+ Generator use the "selenium-assessor-VSCode-project.zip".
6. if you have problems try to find a solution in "troubleshooting.pdf"
7. Compile the final questionnaire => "Questionnaire.docx"
8. Write a short (1 page max) discussion on the assignment (e.g., discuss the results you obtained, which approach you prefer and why...) at the end of the "Questionnaire.docx"
9. Upload all the material (zip file) on Aulaweb

# Delivery
Please deliver a zip file containing the testsuites required, the time sheets filled in and the questionnaire.
